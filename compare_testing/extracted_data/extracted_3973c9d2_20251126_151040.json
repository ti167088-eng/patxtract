If your plan pays\n80% after coinsurance of the allowed amount, then 20% would be your coinsurance.\nCopay Amount (Also known as Copayment): The set fee you pay each time you receive a certain\nservice. Some plans do not have copayments.\nDeductible: The amount, if any, you must pay before we start paying contract benefits. You do not send\nthis amount to us. We subtract this amount from covered expenses on claims you and health care\nprofessionals send us. Some services can be covered before the deductible is met.\nNon-Participating Provider: An out-of-network provider who does not accept rates for services we set to\nkeep your costs down.\nOut-of-Pocket Limit: Once you pay this amount in deductibles, copayments and coinsurance for covered\nservices, we pay 100% of the allowed amount for covered services for the rest of the benefit period.\nParticipating Provider: An in-network or out-of-network provider who accepts agreed-upon rates for\nservices.\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield of linois, a Division of Health Care Service Corporation, a Mutual Legal Reserve Company.",

If your child has a TV, computer, or video game console in the\nbedroom, replace it with a music player. For many kids, dancing and singing are fun ways to get\nmoving.\nLimit sugary drinks. Soda, juice, and sports drinks lead to unhealthy weight gain and tooth decay.\nWater and low-fat or nonfat milk are best to drink. In moderation (6 ounces for a child 6 years old.\nand 8 ounces for a child 7 to 10 years old daily), 100% fruit juice is OK. Save soda and other sugary\ndrinks for special occasions.\nServe nutritious foods. Kecp a variety of healthy foods on hand for snacks, including fresh fruits and\nvegetables, lean meats, and whole grains. Foods like french fries, candy, and snack foods should only\nbe served rarely.\nServe child-sized portions. Children don't need as much food as adults. Serve your child portions\nthat make sense for their age and size. Let your child stop eating when they are full. If your child is\nstill hungry after a meal, offer more vegetables or fruit.\nAsk the healthcare provider about your child's weight. Your child should gain about 4 to 5 pounds\neach year. If your child is gaining more than that, talk to the healthcare provider about healthy eating\nhabits and exercise guidelines.\nBring your child to the dentist at least twice a year for teeth cleaning and a checkup.\nSleeping tips\nNow that your child is in school, a good night's sleep is even more important. At this age, your child needs\nabout 10 hours of sleep each night. Here are some tips:\nSet a bedtime and make sure your child follows it each night.\nTV, computer, and video games can agitate a child and make it hard to calm down for the night. Turn\nthem off at least an hour before bed. Instead, read a chapter of a book together.\n•Remind your child to brush and floss their teeth before bed. Directly supervise your child's dental\nself-care to make sure that both the back teeth and the front teeth are cleaned.\nSafety tips\nRecommendations to keep your child safe include the following:\nWhen riding a bike, your child should wear a helmet with the strap fastened. While roller-skating,\nroller-blading, or using a scooter or skateboard, it's safest to wear wrist guards, elbow pads, knee\npads, and a helmet.\nIn the car, continue to use a booster seat until your child is taller than 4 feet 9 inches. At this height,\nkids are able to sit with the seat belt fitting correctly over the collarbone and hips. Ask the healthcare\nprovider if you have questions about when your child will be ready to stop using a booster seat. All\nchildren younger than 13 should sit in the back seat.\nTeach your child not to talk to strangers or go anywhere with a stranger.\nTeach your child to swim. Many communities offer low-cost swimming lessons. Do not let your",

If you own a gun, always remember to store it unloaded in a\nlocked location. Lock the ammunition in a separate location.\nVaccines\nBased on recommendations from the CDC, at this visit your child may receive the following vaccines:\nDiphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (age 6 only)\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) (ages 9 and up)\nInfluenza (flu), annually\nMeasles, mumps, and rubella (age 6)\nPolio (age 6)\nVaricella (chickenpox) (age 6)\n COVID-19\nBedwetting: It's not your child's fault\nBedwetting, or urinating when sleeping, can be frustrating for both you and your child. But it's usually not\na sign of a major problem. Your child's body may simply need more time to mature. If a child suddenly\nstarts wetting the bed, the cause is often a lifestyle change (such as starting school) or a stressful event\n(such as the birth of a sibling). But whatever the cause, it's not in your child's direct control. If your child\nwets the bed:\nKeep in mind that your child is not wetting on purpose. Never punish or tease a child for wetting the\nbed. Punishment or shaming may make the problem worse, not better.\nTo help your child, be positive and supportive. Praise your child for not wetting and even for trying\nhard to stay dry.\nTwo hours before bedtime don't serve your child anything to drink.\n:\nRemind your child to use the toilet before bed. You could also wake them to use the bathroom before\nyou go to bed yourself.\nHave a routine for changing sheets and pajamas when the child wets. Try to make this routine as\ncalm and orderly as possible. This will help keep both you and your child from getting too upset or\nfrustrated to go back to sleep.\nPut up a calendar or chart and give your child a star or sticker for nights that they don't wet the bed.\nEncourage your child to get out of bed and try to use the toilet if they wake during the night. Put\nnight-lights in the bedroom, hallway, and bathroom to help your child feel safer walking to the\nbathroom.\nIf you have concerns about bedwetting, discuss them with the healthcare provider.\nStayWell last reviewed this educational content on 10/1/2022\n2o0o-2024 The StayWell Cornpany, LLC.

In addition to containing many nutrients a child's body needs, high fruit and vegetable\nconsumption decreases risk of cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Ensure that your child eats fruits and\nvegetables at every meal and as a snack.\n2 hours of screen time or less per day: Children who watch more than two hours of screen time (TV,\ncomputer, video games) per day have double the incidence of obesity when compared to children who\nwatch less than one hour per day. Limit screen time to two hours or less per day and keep children\nphysically active. Children should not be allowed to watch TV before 2 years of age, and there should bc\nno TV in a child's bedroom, no maiter what the child's age.\n1 hour or more of physical activity per day: Physical and mental health significantly improves when\nchildren and teenagers obtain their required 60 minutes of physical activity per day. Encourage your child\nto be active! Have a goal of 60 minutes a day of moderate physical activity.",

In our\nevaluations we seek to join with the neurodiverse community in moving toward neurodiversity-affirming\nlanguage and worldview. This refers to the idea that people have differences in their abilities and how\nthey interact with the world around them - differences that are not considered deficits. At the same time,\nwe recognize that the practical use of our reports is often to gain access to services. For these reasons you\nwill find us using a mix of perspectives. We value the differences neurodiversity brings, while\nacknowledging its impact on daily life. We use the terms \"disorder\" and \"disability\" to acknowledge this\nand to make clear to those who allocate services that the person we are writing about should be\nconsidered eligible to receive these services.\nDevelopmental Pediatrics\nCARS Clinic\n;\nPatient Name:\nEliava Dawit\nDate of Birth: 8/27/2021\nAge:\n3 year 2 morith old\n$\nSubjective\n=\nInterpreter needed: No - parents speak English, Tigrigna, and Amharic and decline interpretation\nservices for today's visit\nPresenting Concerns:\nEliava Dawit is a 3 year old girl referred to Developmental!Pediatrics by Janine Young, M.D. for a\nconsultation regarding concerns for]speech delays and autism.

The CARS-2 is used\non children ages 2 and older. Areas measured on the CARS-2 include relating to people, imitation,\nemotional responses, body use, object use, adaptation to change, visual response, listening response,\ntase, smell and touch response, fearlor nervousness, verbal communication, nonverbal communication ,\nactivity level and general impressioni.\nThe CARS-2 consists of 15 domains assessing behaviors associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder and\nyielding a total score. Each domain is scored on a scale of 1-4, including half scores; higher scores are\nassociated with a higher level of impairment. Total scores can range from a low of 15 to a high of 60;\nand higher indicate severe symptoms.

Parental history and clinical observation were notable for inconsistent use of non-verbal\nmethods of communication including pointing and eye contact, inconsistent joint attention, difficulties\nwith integrating verbal and non verbal modes of communication, and stereotyped language and motor\nmovements. While she does demonistrate these skills at times, they are inconsistent and not always well\nintegrated. While there was some engagement with provider during today's evaluation, joint attention\nwas brief and unsustained, she did hot use integrated eye contact or other non-verbal modalities to\nrequest or engage in joint attention with provider (briefly noted at times with her mother), and play\nwas parallel in nature. She was observed to flap her hands and use a loud, high pitched vocalization\nwhen excited. She does have notable strengths in areas of imitation and pretend play, as well as an\noverall easy going demeanor without significant behavioral challenges. Using information taken from\nhistory, clinical observation, and conduction of CARS-2 rating scale, Eliava meets diagnostic criteria for\na diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Recommended levels of support include Level 2 in the area of\nsocial-communication and Level 1 in the area of restricted interests/repetitive behaviors. Additional\ndiagnoses include her historical diagnosis of speech delays.

In our\nevaluations we seek to join with the neurodiverse community in moving toward neurodiversity-affirming\nlanguage and worldview. This refers to the idea that people have differences in their abilities and how\nthey interact with the world around them - differences that are not considered deficits. At the same time,\nwe recognize that the practical use of our reports is often to gain access to services. For these reasons you\nwill find us using a mix of perspectives. We value the differences neurodiversity brings, while\nacknowledging its impact on daily life. We use the terms \"disorder\" and \"disability\" to acknowledge this\nand to make clear to those who allocate services that the person we are writing about should be\nconsidered eligible to receive these services.\nDevelopmental Pediatrics\nPatient Name:\nBryan Manzi\nDate of Birth: 4/7/2018\nAge:\n6 year 10 month old\nSubjective\nInterpreter needed: No\nPresenting Concerns:\nBryan Manzi is a 6 year old boy seen today in Developmental Pediatrics to establish medical care. Bryan\ncompleted an evaluation with Alyssa Schlenz, PhD in Developmental Pediatrics in December 2024 to\nevaluate his developmental strengths and weaknesses, to guide recommendations to supplement his\ncurrent therapy plan, and to establish care. His previous diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Disorder and\ndelayed milestones were maintained. He was also noted to have feeding difficulties, sleep difficulties,\ntoilet training concerns, hyperactive/impulsive behaviors, anxiety symptoms, and pica.

Bryan currently attends ABA full time, with\nplans to pursue a mixture of ABA and school next year. He also receives speech and occupational\ntherapies twice weekly. Bryan has difficulties with attention and distractibility that are beyond what we\nwould expect for developmental level, and are consistent with a diagnosis of ADHD. Vanderbilt forms\nprovided today for parents and ABA therapists to fill out. Given the significance of his impulsivity and\nsafety concerns, initiation of stimulant medication was reviewed. He is a picky eater for which updated\nlab work will be obtained, although growth is reassuring at this time. He wakes often in the middle of\nthen night and previously had very low ferritin levels at 5. It is unclear if he has ever taken iron\nsupplementation in the past, levels to be rechecked. Constipation is currently being managed with\nMiralax. He needs updated audiology testing given language delays, however will implement after\nADHD symptoms better treated as they have had significant difficulties testing him in the past. He has\nhad previous imaging including brain MRI and EEG in November 2023 in the context of developmental\nregression and vomiting at the time. EEG with diffuse slowing, brain MRI with non-specific findings at\nthe time with consideration to repeat in 6-12 months. We reviewed today the potential to repeat\nimaging as well as updated lab work while sedated. For significant behavioral challenges, his father is\ninterested in participating in the RUBl program. Given his Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis and\ndevelopmental delays, a genetic etiology should be considered.\nDiagnoses:\nEncounter Diagnoses\nCode\nName\nPrimary?\nF84.0\nYes\nAutism spectrum disorder\nF90.9\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), unspecified ADHD type\nR62.0\nDelayed milestone\nR63.30\nFeeding difficulties\n G47.9\nSleep difficulties\nMedical Recommendations:\n1. Genetic Testing: Given Bryan's diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder, we discussed genetic testing\nfor neurodevelopmental differences. Genetic testing may provide an explanation for an individual's\ndifferences, clarify recurrence risks, and can potentially guide medical management; we are able to\nidentify an underlying cause for an individual's neurodevelopmental differences in about 15-30% of\nbroad neurodevelopmental panel to Bryan's family to assess for genetic causes of Bryan's\n<uratovich.

Bryan's family is interested in genetic testing\nand have been referred to our genetic counselor for a further discussion about genetic testing and\npossible outcomes.\n2. A follow up MRI is recommended based on his imaging completed in 11/2023. You can call\nRadiology at 720-777-5650 to schedule this.\n3. We will order baseline labs to be collected when he is sedated for his MRI.\n4. Please fill out the Vanderbilt form provided in clinic today. It would also be helpful for one of his\nABA therapists to fill out the form.\n5. Medication Considerations\na. Due to concerns about Attention/Hyperactivity/Impulsivity we recommend a trial of the\nfollowing medication classes\ni. Stimulants:\n1. Stimulant medications include medications like Methylphenidate/Ritalin and\nMixed Amphetamine Salts/Adderall. They come in both short and long-\nacting versions. Many school aged children prefer the long-acting version so\nthey do not have to take medication at school. Which medication you start\nwith is often chosen based on desired starting dose, family history of\nmedication, and what form of medication your child can take (liquid,\nsprinkles, pills).\n2. What these medications will help with: Stimulant medications are considered\nfirst line treatment for ADHD and can help improve focus, attention,\nhyperactivity and impulsivity.\n3. All the medications in this group have the same side effects, but whether a\nchild has a certain side effect can vary between medications in the group.\na. Common side effects:\ni. The most common side effects are headache and\nstomachache which should resolve within a couple of days\nafter starting the medication, decreased appetite, and sleep\nchanges.\nii. Some children will become irritable or emotional; this can\nhappen throughout the day, or when the medication is\ndecreasing in their system.\niii. These medications can also increase the heart rate and blood\npressure slightly, but do not cause long term heart problems\nin a normal heart\nb. Monitoring: While on these medications it is important to have your\nchild's weight and blood pressure periodically checked.\n6. START Ritalin (methylphenidate) dose: 5 mg (5 mL), to target Attention/Hyperactivity/Impulsivity\na. Please monitor for the following side effects: decreased appetite, weight loss/poor weight\ngain, tics, sleep disturbance, behavioral/mood/thought disturbances, irritability, Gl\ndisturbance, dry mouth, chest pain, high blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, shortness of\nbreath, headache, or other side effects.\n7.

Even if the practitioners completes this type of form \r\nand puts it in their chart, this supplier-generated form is not a substitute for the comprehensive \r\nmedical record. Suppliers are encouraged to help educate practitioners on the type of information \r\nthat is needed to document a beneficiary’s mobility needs.\r\nThe information that the supplier must obtain before submitting a claim to the DME \r\ncontractor is described in detail in the Power Mobility LCD and Policy Article. However, \r\nif the DME MAC or other Medicare Contractor asks for documentation on individual \r\nclaims, additional documents (e.g., notes from prior visits, test reports, etc.) shall also be \r\nobtained from the treating practitioners to provide a historical perspective that reflects the \r\nbeneficiary’s condition in the continuum of care, corroborating the information in the face￾to-face examination, painting a picture of the beneficiary’s condition and progression of \r\ndisease over time.\r\nGROUP 2 POVs (K0806 – K0808)\r\nGroup 2 POVs have added capabilities that are not needed for use in the home. Therefore, \r\nif a Group 2 POV is provided it will be denied as not reasonable and necessary.",

Alcohol use is to be avoided when taking this drug The side effects may\n p  xtl ue p  e Te  lizn \nuse and possible adverse effects of an anesthetic patch All of the patient's questions and concerns were addressed\nMedrol Dose Pack : I discussed with the patient that this medication is a steroid medication used to treat inflammation. The medication is taken over\na defined penod of days in decreasing doses There are few mild side effects. Nausea, heartbum. and headache are among the more commonly\nreported side effects Steroid medication can weaken your immune system and therefore it is important to avoid being in contact with people who\nare ill. Blood sugar levels can be increased by this medicine; if you are diabetic, it is important to monitor your glucose closely on this medicine.\nNarcotics : I discussed with the patient that these drugs can cause stomach upset, constipation. or nausea. Short term use of these medicines is\nrecommended because long term use can cause addiction.\nNSAIDS : I discussed with the patient that NSAIDs should be taken with food. Prolonged use of NSAIDs can result in the development of stomach\nulcers or bleeding Patient advised to stop taking NSAlDs if abdominal pain occurs. The patient verbalized understanding of the proper use and\npossible adverse effects of NSAlDs All of the patient's questions and concerns were addressed\nPhysical Therapy : Physical therapy focuses on stretching of your calf muscles and plantar fascia There may also be focus on foot and toe\nexercises, icing. and therapeutic massage Ultrasound may help to reduce the inflammation Therapeutic exercises can be performed to help the\ncondition As the symptoms resolve. rehabilitation generally progresses nto more functional activity exercises. such as walking.\nSurgical Options and Alternatives\nExtracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy : This is a noninvasive procedure that employs high energy shock waves to heal the plantar fascia. The\nresults with this method of treatment are unpredictable.\nGastrocnemius Recession : During this procedure one of the muscles (gastrocnemius) of your calf is lengthened either through an open incision or\nvia the use of an endoscope Risks include infection. wound complications, and injury to tendons. nerves. and blood vessels.\nPotential for Future Surgery : I explained that though I am not recommending a surgical intervention at this time. this may be recommended or\nnecessary in the future to alleviate or treat this condition. especially if conservative measures fail or the condition continues to progress or worsen.\nSteroid injection : I discussed with the patient that this involves the injection of a potent antinflammatory substance (cortisone) mixed with an\nanesthetic into the plantar fascia Risks include whitening of the skin at the injection site and a transient rise in blood glucose. Complications are\nrare; infection is the most common. Too many injections may cause rupture of the plantar fascia.\nConservative Options and Alternatives\nFunctional Orthotics : Functional orthotics are to be used to evenly distribute pressure across the affected area and improve foot biomechanics.\nStrapping/Splinting : Strapping and/or splinting align the arch. stretch soft tissues and improve comfort without intending to permanently correct the\ndeformity\nSteroid Injection : Steroid injections are recommended as pant of plantar fascitis management oftentimes to reduce the swelling of bursitis\nassociated with the deformity.\nExtracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy : This is a noninvasive procedure that employs high energy shock waves to heal the plantar fascia The\nresults with this method of treatment are unpredictable\nDiagnostic Imaging Results\nI reviewed and discussed the results of the X-Ray(s) with the patient.\nAfter counseling the patient. we decided on the following plan RiGHT:\n• I had a lengthy discussion with the patient on the fact that I disagree with heel spur resection surgery.

Plantar fascitis occurs when the fascia (a band of tissue) on the bottom of your foot becomes irritated\nand inflamed from overuse. Often there is no identifiable cause. however. it is generally accepted that obesity and repetitive impact sports are risk\nfactors. Overuse. trauma. and generalized inflammatory conditions may be causative factors as well. Conservative options are fairly broad and\ninclude rest, ice. corrective shoewear. splints. heel pads. or orthotics. foot and toe exercises. massage therapy. and physical therapy. Cortisone\ninjection may be helptul on a limited basis. Surgical treatment is reserved for those cases that do not respond to conservative management.\nMohomad Al-Sawah (Primary",

Nausea, hearbumn. and headache are among the more commonly\nreported side eftects Steroid medication can weaken your immune system and therefore it is important to avoid being in contact with people who\nare ill Blood sugar levels can be increased by this medicine; if you are diabetic, it is important to monitor your glucose closely on this medicine.\nNarcotics : I discussed with the patient that these drugs can cause stomach upset, constipation. or nausea. Short term use of these medicines is\nrecommended because long term use can cause addiction.\nNSAIDS : I discussed with the patient that NSAIDs should be taken with food. Prolonged use of NSAIDs can result in the development of stomach\nulcers or bleeding Patient advised to stop taking NSAiDs if abdominal pain occurs. The patient verbalized understanding of the proper use and\npossible adverse effects of NSAlDs All of the patient's questions and concerns were addressed\nPhysical Therapy : Physical therapy focuses on stretching of your calf muscles and plantar fascia There may also be focus on foot and toe\nexercises. icing. and therapeutic massage Ultrasound may help to reduce the inflammation Therapeutic exercises can be performed to help the\ncondition As the symptoms resolve. rehabilitation generally progresses nto more functional activity exercises. such as walking\nSurgical Options and Alternatives\nExtracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy : This is a noninvasive procedure that employs high energy shock waves to heal the plantar fascia. The\nresults with this method of treatment are unpredictable.\nGastrocnemius Recession : During this procedure one of the muscles (gastrocnemius) of your cal is lengthened either through an open incision or\nvia the use of an endoscope Risks incude infection. wound complications, and injury to tendons. nerves. and blood vessels.\nPotential for Future Surgery : I explained that though I am not recommending a surgical intervention at this time. this may be recommended or\nnecessary in the future to alleviate or treat this condition. especially if conservative measures fail or the condition continues to progress or worsen.\nSteroid injection : I discussed with the patient that this involves the injection of a potent antinflammatory substance (cortisone) mixed with an\nanesthetic into the plantar fascia Risks include whitening of the skin at the injection site and a transient rise in blood glucose. Complications are\nrare; infection is the most common. Too many injections may cause rupture of the plantar fascia.\nConservative Options and Alternatives\nFunctional Orthotics : Functional orthotics are to be used to evenly distribute pressure across the affected area and improve foot biomechanics.\nStrapping/Splinting : Strapping and/or splinting align the arch. stretch soft tissues and improve comfort without intending to permanently correct the\ndeformity\nSteroid Injection : Steroid injections are recommended as pan of plantar fascitis management oftentimes to reduce the swelling of bursitis\nassociated with the deformity.\nExtracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy : This is a noninvasive procedure that employs high energy shock waves to heal the plantar fascia The\nresults with this method of treatment are unpredictable\nDiagnostic Imaging Results\nI reviewed and discussed the results of the X-Ray(s) with the patient.\nAfter counseling the patient. we decided on the following plan RiGHT:\n• I had a lengthy discussion with the patient on the fact that I disagree with heel spur resection surgery. We will exhaust stretching exercise\nphysical therapy activity modification orthotic therapy and better shoes Should she need surgical intervention this would be gastrocnemius\nrecession with likely a biologic injection into the plantar fashion plantar heel I do not advise any plantar calcaneal spur resection surgery\n2.\nEquumus Comuaciora, Slateral\nC3O4 anP (4372)\nCemoa6, sgh ankle (624,571)\nPlan: Counseling - Equinus Contracture.\nMusculoskeletal Care: Treatment depends on the cause of the tendon contracture. Conservative management includes orthotic use, serial casting.\nand physical therapy aimed at stretching and strengthening. Shoewear modification may also be advised. Surgery may be indicated if there has\nbeen failure of conservative therapy or a fixed contracture.\nExpectations: Contracture of the Achilles tendon can occur for a vaniety of reasons Some people are born with a tight achilles tendon while others\nmay develop the contracture as a result of prior fracture surgery. a neurologic condition. or compartment syndrome. Chronic wear of high heeled\nshoes may put an individual at risk of developing this condtion. Patients typically have limited range of motion of the foot and may have difficulty\nputting the heel down on the ground fully. An aching sensation on the back of the ankle may be present The diagnosis is made by clinical\nexamination of the affected foot.\nContact Office if the pain worsens or you experience increasing ankle weakness.\nActive Therapy : Active therapies incude stretching and strengthening exercises for the ankle and adjacent joints.\nPassive Therapy : Passive therapies include ice, heat. massage. ultrasound. and electrical stimulation.\nMohomad Al-Sawah (Primary Provider) (Bill Under)\nPage\n(249) 717-0000 Work\nEpic Dearoorn\n2272",
